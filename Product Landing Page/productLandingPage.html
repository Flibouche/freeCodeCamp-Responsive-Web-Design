                        <h2>The Film</h2>
                        <p>Indie Game: The Movie is the first feature documentary film about making video games. It
                            looks
                            specifically at the underdogs of the video game industry, indie game developers, who
                            sacrifice
                            money,
                            health and sanity to realize their lifelong dreams of sharing their visions with the
                            world.<br><br>
                            After two years of painstaking work, designer Edmund McMillen and programmer Tommy Refenes
                            await
                            the
                            release of their first major game for Xbox, Super Meat Boy—the adventures of a skinless boy
                            in
                            search of
                            his girlfriend, who is made of bandages. At PAX, a major video-game expo, developer Phil
                            Fish
                            unveils his
                            highly anticipated, four-years-in-the-making FEZ. Jonathan Blow considers beginning a new
                            game
                            after
                            creating Braid, one of the highest-rated games of all time. Four developers, three games,
                            and
                            one ultimate
                            goal— to express oneself through a video game.<br><br>
                            Indie Game: The Movie is about the creative process and putting yourself out there through
                            your
                            work. It’s
                            a journey many filmmakers, creators, artists, entrepreneurs - many people, can relate to in
                            the
                            digital
                            era.<br><br>

                        <h2>The Release</h2>
                        <p>Indie Game: The Movie was released in several innovative ways.<br><br>
                            The filmmakers self-released Indie Game: The Movie theatrically in the US & Canada in May &
                            June
                            2012. It
                            opened initially in New York, LA, Seattle, San Francisco & Toronto. It expanded into other
                            markets and
                            qualified for the Academy Awards.<br><br>
                            Just prior to that, they organized a sold-out 15-city, in-person US tour, presented by
                            Adobe.
                            The tour
                            brought out big crowds and was instrumental in building enthusiasm for the film and the
                            eventual
                            release.<br><br>
                            Soon after the theatrical opening, Indie Game: The Movie released world-wide on iTunes
                            (topping
                            the charts
                            at #1 in documentaries & #14 of all movies). It was first feature film released on Steam,
                            one of
                            the world’s
                            biggest gaming platforms, and it was released on the film’s website DRM-free, powered by
                            VHX.
